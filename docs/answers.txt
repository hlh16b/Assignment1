Branching allows for many improvements, including the ability to test features 
in a new file without potentially breaking existing code while maintaining all
previous commits. Also, it makes it easier for people who are in essence working
together in parallel.

(e)
Git log shows a list of all previous commits and alterations to files with the correct
flags, however, git status merely shows you the current directory and others to be 
uploaded, for detail on this information you would have to use git log.

(f)
git log Weapon.h

git log --grep=file

	(I)		Inheritance in object oriented programming is where one class, typically 
			called the "child", inherents all functions and variables from another,
			the "parent" class. It's usually used for something basic, whereas "cars"
			would be the parent class and a specific example, ie a Hyundai or something,
			would be an instance of the child class.
	(II)		In essence polymorphism appears to be an extension of inheritence, as 
			it is typically used in an effort to use code in different ways without
			having to rewrite it for every instance. With polymorphism, many different
			types of objects will have a function of the same name that does the same
			thing in general, but how it does it different for each one.
	(III)
			Encapsulation refers primarily to how an object is 'built', in essence 
			combining an object with the variables and functions while hiding the
			'private' information to prevent the user from changing it in a way that
			would ultimately crash or break the code.

In the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow method, there is in essence a hierarchy
in the creation. Everybody and pull from the repository, however only the dictator
can push to it. The dictator receives code from the lieutenants, who receive code
from the various developers. The lieutenants  merge and solve conflicts for the
various developer code, and pass it on to the director who can then merge changes
between the lietenants code and push it. In the Integration management workflow method,
however, while everybody can still pull from the central repository everybody then
pushes to their own private repository, and it is up to an integration manager who
combines all code and pushes it to the main repository.
(j)
In a large setting, such as a team of 100 developers, it would make more sense to
follow the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow than the Centralized workflow. This
would in essence save time as it is the job of the leiutenants to merge code and only
the director can push, rather than it being up to the individual developer to resolve
any conflicts and everybody having the power to push to the repository. Because it is 
the job of a smaller branch of people it allows the others to get to work on something
else, and minimizes the conflicts to resolve at the highest point of the hierarchy, 
the director. Plus, it decreases the possiblity of each persons copy of the code
being different with only a small number of people capable of altering the repository.

The RoleGame prototype uses polymorphism in that the entire system is based on a Weapon class,
with sub classes that feature the particular weapon; ie, Common Spear, Common Sword, Simple
Hammer, Crazy Random Sword, etc. This is a primary example of the use of polymorphism, especially
given the function all sub classes share; hit. Furthermore, there is encapsulation as all necessary
information was hidden within the classes, unable to be edited while running the code.
